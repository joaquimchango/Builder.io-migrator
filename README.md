# Builder.io Content Migrator 

This project is a minimal app made for Builder.io users, it is designed to allow migrating content models from one space to another.

## How does it work 

1. Add your Private Keys to initiate the migration process , you need the Private api key of your source space, and the one from your target space.

2. Press load if the models do not appear instantly. Select the models you want to import to the target space

3. Press Import model and entries ; the app will migrate all published entries to your target space. The imported entries will be unpublised by default.



* This app does not keep any memory of your private keys. You cannot save your settings , if something is not working, it is likely due to a mistake in your private keys, you will have to start again.
